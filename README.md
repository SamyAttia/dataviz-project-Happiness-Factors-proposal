# World Happiness Report 2022:
# An Interactive Visualization

The World Happiness Report 2022 offers fascinating insights into the factors that contribute to happiness across nations. Leveraging this rich dataset, I created an interactive visualization to uncover patterns and correlations among happiness factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more. This project merges data storytelling with user-centric interactivity to deliver an engaging and informative exploration of happiness worldwide.

## Data

The dataset is sourced from the World Happiness Report 2022 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2022?select=World+Happiness+Report+2022.csv), It provides comprehensive metrics for 146 countries, detailing factors such as:

* GDP per capita
* Social support
* Healthy life expectancy
* Freedom to make life choices
* Generosity
* Perceptions of corruption

Flags for countries are sourced from the Circle Flags Gallery to enhance visual clarity. https://hatscripts.github.io/circle-flags/gallery

## Project Objectives

This project aims to answer critical questions through visualization:

 * What is the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores?
 * How are happiness scores distributed geographically?
 * Which factors drive happiness in the top-ranking countries?
 * Can we identify outliers—countries with high happiness despite low perceptions of corruption?
 * How do happiness scores differ across continents?

## Development Journey

## Initial Sketches
The project began with conceptual sketches, envisioning multiple visualization components:

* Interactive Map: Highlighting geographic trends and happiness scores across all countries.
* Side Panels: Displaying the top and bottom 5 countries with detailed factor breakdowns.
* Scatter Plots: Offering deeper insights into factor relationships.
   
## Interactive Features

## Dynamic Map
* Circles represent countries, scaled and color-coded by happiness scores.
* Hovering over a circle displays detailed data, including happiness score, GDP, and rank.

## Side Panels
* The left panel highlights the top 5 happiest countries, while the right panel features the bottom 5.
* Each panel includes donut charts visualizing factor contributions like GDP, life expectancy, and social support.

## Scatter Plots
* Explore how happiness factors correlate with scores through an interactive tooltip featuring scatter plots for factors like GDP and life expectancy.

## Interactive Legend
* Filter countries by score ranges (e.g., >7.0, 6.0-7.0) using the legend. Highlighted countries dynamically adjust based on the selected range.

## Key Insights

* Happiest Countries: Finland, Denmark, and Iceland rank highest, driven by strong social support, high GDP, and life expectancy.
* Least Happy Countries: Afghanistan and Zimbabwe score lowest, reflecting economic challenges and limited social infrastructure.
* Geographic Trends: Northern Europe consistently outperforms other regions, while parts of Africa and the Middle East show lower scores.
* Factor Analysis: GDP, life expectancy, and social support emerge as the strongest predictors of happiness in top-ranking nations.

## Next Steps

This visualization serves as a foundation for deeper analysis and storytelling. Future enhancements could include:

* Region-specific breakdowns.
* Year-over-year happiness trends.
* Predictive modeling to forecast future scores.
  
This project showcases my ability to design, code, and deliver interactive data visualizations, making it a proud addition to my portfolio.
